We are an eclectic group of people based in Brisbane, Australia, who share a belief that general participation in the proliferation of computers is the key to avoiding a digital future rife with misuse and misappropriation of our electronic resources by governments, businesses, and other malicious individuals.

We welcome anyone, regardless of technical ability. We believe that greater diversity makes the group stronger. We believe that the dialogue around computing needs voices from both the technically proficient, and casual users of computers, and it is only through a plurality of voices that we can move forward.

We believe that the general purpose computer has fundamentally, and irrevocably, changed how people live. We are interested in philosophical, introspective, and artistic explorations of this effect.

There is no formal membership, no membership dues. Anyone is welcome at events, and we encourage you to get in touch with suggestions for events.
